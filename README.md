# Mond language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting, snippets, and linting support for Mond in Atom.

For optimal pleasure, also use the following packages:
* [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) (required for linting to work)
* [autocomplete](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete)
* [autocomplete-snippets](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-snippets)

pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
